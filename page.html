                    <div class="post-item-home-excerpt">
                        <p>A while ago, I wrote a post on <a href="http://www.alessiatroisi.com/our-decision-to-go-bio/" target="_blank">our decision to go Bio.</a> (Which in both German &amp; Italian is the correct term, but my English friend informs me it's actually "organic". These are the perils of living in non English speaking countries for a long period of time!)</p>

                        <p>Anyway, so hand in hand with that decision was another very important decision which was to get back in shape. If I needed any confirmation of the need to do so, when I was in England one of my many nicknames was <em>pudding abs. </em></p>

                        <p>Thinking back to my childhood, I realise I was always quite active. I played lots of sport (none of which I was very good at), I danced (again, I did the world a favour by stopping), and my siblings and I played in the garden almost every day. If not swimming, we played tennis or soccer with our dad. In short we were always outside, running around barefoot.</p>

                        <p>I was also very health concious from a young age. I remember deciding when I was 8 that I'd rather drink water than fizzy drinks. (I was born serious!) I used to pack brown bread in my lunches and I limited the snacks that I'd take with me to school. It's like I had this built in sensibility. It makes me laugh when I think back. It must've been like watching a 30 year old woman trapped in an 8 year old's body.</p>

                        <p>The ironic thing is, out of all the family, I was also always the chubby one. I have 4 extremely skinny siblings, one that used to be chubby like me and then one day somehow turned into Muscle Mania. Men. Work out for one week and you can see the difference!  (Although looking at the photo I don't look particularly chubby. I was probably just comparing myself to skinny subjects.)</p>

                        <p>I was always aware of being slightly bigger than my siblings and my friends, and when I became an adolescent, it obviously became an issue for me. In my last year of high school, determined to lose weight, I abandoned my good habits and started replacing lunch with coffee and a few slices of cold meat. I would try and skip carbohydrates as far as possible in the evening as well.</p>

                        <p>x</p>

                        <p>p.s. I realise everyone's story and journey is different. This is just a little bit of mine and some lessons I've learnt along the way. No criticism or judgement intended, only love here!</p>
